## About the Project
*Specific details about the project will be added later*

Students like myself and others often use grade calculation to determine what grades we need on future assignments to achieve the grades we want in class. In order to address this issue, I created this tool. In similar fashion to my [password generator](https://roberts-password-generator.netlify.app/), this grade calulator has a very simple and unobtrusive interface. With this grade calculator, deployment and development are quick and easy due to its lightweight design. This is possible because of the simple HTML and JavaScript configuration.

## Compile Instructions
For Windows, there are multiple options, some are:
* Download or copy index.html and open the file from the file explorer.
* Run with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Website Link
